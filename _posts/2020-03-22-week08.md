### Remote Learning/My Reaction
Personally, I do not like the idea of remote learning because I am unable to focus taking classes online. I feel different since I'm at home and it's my comfort zone; class is a different scenario since you get the vibe to learn and the environment makes me feel like I need to learn. Though I am still trying to grasp this situation because last week I had to stock up since the resources are depleting and I doubt we would be able to leave our houses in 4 weeks. By 8 weeks, I can think of 2 scenarios; optimistically speaking, the cure would have been found and the government would have started distributing it. Pessimistically speaking, we would have completely drained out all the resources and water would be going scarce, population would be decreasing drastically and people would fear to talk to each other.
