* There are a couple of skills taht I can bring to the FOSS project. I have worked with different flavors of linux such as **Centos** and **Red Hat**. I also have experience working as a team. I personally believe that collaborating in a team is really important because they might have skills that I don't have and by working as a team we can create a almost perfect Open Source project.

* I enjoy listening to music when i am stressed. It works like yoga for me. Moreover, I like palying ping pong when ever I have free time, I go to the gaming center at Hunter North.
