I decided to take this course because this is one of the courses that will help me collaborate with my team of developers in the future. I haven't actually learned Github because I couldn't spare some time to learn it last semester and over the break so I decide to take this course which will force me to learn it. Moreover, I am not that good communicating verbally with people so I'm glad this course will make me interact with individuals and work with them as a team since collaboration and presenting projects will be very important when I get a job. Therefore, I decided to take this course in order to build my communication as well as team collaboration skills that will help me in the long run.
