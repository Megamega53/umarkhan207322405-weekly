###Project Evaluation Feedback
I worked with Tarek and Keisuki and our project was evaluating  Visual Code Studio.It was fun working with them and learned a lot about contributing to an open Source project. It gave a better understanding on how issues are resolved. How a maintainer maintains a project and how other can contribute.

####3 Projects I would like to work on
I would love to work on free code camp. It seems like it's a small project which means there is a lot to contribute to the project. Moreover, it is a very friendly project where the maintainers welcome everyone and solve issues as soon as possible. I would also like to contribute to **Atom**. I evaluated Atom and it fascinated me on how they use mostly Javadcript and very little css and other languages. Anotehr Project I would liek to contribute to is Jupyter. I want to learn how it works and how it was developed. Thus, I am very intereted in all the projects listed but would like to contribute more to free code camp since it contians a lot of bugs.
