I have researched quite a bit and came across a couple of projects. One of the projects I researched is called [LTCleanerFOSS](https://github.com/TheRedSpy15/LTECleanerFOSS) which is an Android App to clean irrevelant data in the phone. I decided not to work on this project because it does not meet the requirement of having all 4 files. The repository is missing **Contributions.md** file. I have also came acroos another project called [ProjectLearn-Project-Based-Learning](https://github.com/Xtremilicious/ProjectLearn-Project-Based-Learning), which is a web app for beginners who are interested in learning programming languages. I decided not to do this project as well since its missing **Code of Conduct** file. As of now, I have not come across a project that I wanna work on and meets the requirement of having all 4 files, but I will keep on looking.
